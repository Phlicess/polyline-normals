# polyline-mesh

[![stable](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/stable.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

A utility for polyline rendering purely on the GPU.

For more complex line joins and end caps, see [extrude-polyline](https://nodei.co/npm/extrude-polyline/) (which builds a triangulated geometry). At some point, some of the code may be unified between these two modules.
