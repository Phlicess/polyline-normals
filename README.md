# polyline-normals

[![experimental](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/experimental.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

Not complete.

Produces normals for a polyline, with their miter lengths (in the case of a join). 

For more complex line joins and end caps, see [extrude-polyline](https://nodei.co/npm/extrude-polyline/) (which builds a triangulated geometry). At some point, some of the code may be unified between these two modules. 

## example

This is useful for expanding thick 2D lines in a vertex shader.
